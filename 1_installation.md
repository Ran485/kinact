title: Installation

As of now, `kinact` is not yet a proper python package available via `pip`. Therefore, installation is a bit more tedious, but should be more or less straightforward, since kinact does not need any fancy dependencies.

## Mac/Linux Users

Open a command line or terminal window. You can clone the repository using git and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saezlab/kinact.git
cd kinact
python setup.py install
```

## Windows Users

We are working on it :-)
